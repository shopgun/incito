# Incito

Incito is a platform agnostic way to define layout using [JSON](https://www.json.org).

## Reasoning

Since 2009, [ShopGun](https://shopgun.com) has been working with catalogs from retail businesses. Almost all of these businesses create the catalogs for physical distribution in mailboxes. They also create a PDF version of the catalog that can be viewed digitally. There's numerous companies that specialize in making these PDF's readable online. We believe we're at a point where we've reached the potential of the PDF because it's difficult to ensure a great user experience across devices and screen sizes. For years, we've wanted to create an alternative to the PDF that continues to allow businesses to distribute their catalog online. We call it [Incito](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/incito) (`/ˈin.ki.toː/`): from in- (“in, at, on”) +‎ citō (“set in rapid motion; encourage, incite”).

We think the catalog in PDF form is great in a lot of ways:

###  Control

Businesses control exactly how the design and layout should look. Once the PDF has been built they can distribute anywhere knowing their brand will be represented the way they want.

### Distribution

Multiple companies, including ShopGun, allow businesses to upload their PDF. For example, a business can upload their PDF to ShopGun where we'll generate a reading experience from it for all of our users.

### Inspiration

Because of the control over design and layout, businesses can create a truly inspiring experience that can set them apart from the competition. Instead of looking at a boring same size grid on a webshop, the PDF offers an inspiring experience where each page is new and unique.

However, while great in many ways it also has some downsides:

### Static

The PDF is not responsive in the sense it has a fixed width and height no matter what device you use:
