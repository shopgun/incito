## Overview

Incito Publication Format is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format used to create automated platform agnostic publication layout for product catalogs, online shops, or any other layout.

A publication created with the Incito Publication Format (v1.0.0) can include text, images, and videos. You can enhance your publication with animations, behaviors, and customized styles that allow the creation of a unique look and feel for each publication, according to the publishers brand requirements. The finished publication can be published anywhere and is rendered with the help of the [Shopgun-SDK](https://shopgun.com/developers).

With Incito, you only have to author your publication once. Every publication is then automatically optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop view.
