# Incito

Incito is a platform agnostic way to define layout using [JSON](https://www.json.org).

## Reasoning

Since 2009, [ShopGun](https://shopgun.com) has been working with catalogs from retail businesses. Almost all of these businesses create the catalogs for physical distribution in mailboxes. They also create a PDF version of the catalog that can be viewed digitally. There's numerous companies that specialize in making these PDF's readable online. We believe we're at a point where we've reached the potential of the PDF because it's difficult to ensure a great user experience across devices and screen sizes. For years, we've wanted to create an alternative to the PDF that continues to allow businesses to distribute their catalog online. We call it [Incito](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/incito) (`/ˈin.ki.toː/`): from in- (“in, at, on”) +‎ citō (“set in rapid motion; encourage, incite”).

Incito tries to take all the good parts and remove all of the bad parts from the PDF. We think the catalog in PDF form is great in a lot of ways:

###  Control

Businesses control exactly how the design and layout should look. Once the PDF has been built they can distribute anywhere knowing their brand will be represented the way they want.

### Distribution

Multiple companies, including ShopGun, allow businesses to upload their PDF. For example, a business can upload their PDF to ShopGun where we'll generate a reading experience from it for all of our users.

### Inspiration

Because of the control over design and layout, businesses can create a truly inspiring experience that can set them apart from the competition. Instead of looking at a boring same size grid on a webshop, the PDF offers an inspiring experience where each page is new and unique.

### Platform Agnostic

You can open a PDF on a Mac, PC, etc. and you'll get the same experience. A PDF is not tied to a specific platform and we didn't want that to happen for Incito either. That means Incito is not a HTML solution. It's defined in JSON, which is supported everywhere. It takes a lot of inspiration from the Android XML layout and Apple News JSON specifications, however.

The PDF also has some downsides:

### One Size Fits All

The PDF is not responsive in the sense it has a fixed width and height no matter what device you use:

Ratio #1 | Ratio #2 | Ratio #3
--- | --- | ---

With Incito, you can generate optimized versions for each device and screen.

### Text Legibility

Because the PDF is usually meant for physical distribution it's not a concern how it looks when scaled down. However, when making a digital reading experience you have to fit to the device screen. It means users have to zoom in on regions they are interested in and pan around. And it usually also means a larger image has to be fetched.

With Incito, there's no need to zoom and all text is easy to read.

### Accessibility

Because the PDF usually gets rendered into images, accessibility goes out of the window. Screen readers don't have a chance in reading each page out loud. And even when using a screen reader with a PDF it's not optimized for accessibility and structured nicely.

With Incito, it's optimized for accessibility and you can even translate the text to another language on the fly.

### Production

PDF's are not quick to produce and cannot be generated by machine alone. Usually, you have to set a lot of it up manually in e.g. InDesign. We recognize there's a lot of smart tooling available out there making it quick to setup various grids, etc. But the fact humans have to be involved in the process means you cannot automate it 100 %.

### Optimization

Because humans are involved in creating PDF's you'll never be able to generate personal and optimized catalogs. With Incito, machines create the catalog (with guidelines from humans, of course) meaning you can create a highly optimized version for each individual and device.

## Versions

All versions are defined as JSON schemas to ensure proper types and structure.

- [v1.0.0](/schemas/v1.0.0.json)

## Libraries

- [JavaScript](https://github.com/shopgun/incito-browser)

Going forward, we'll launch libraries for iOS and Android as well.

## Generator

By itself, the Incito format isn't of much value. You need to actually generate some content for people to look at. ShopGun has developed a service that can transform your feeds to Incito. Automatically. The service revolves around businesses within retail that can provide a feed of a set of offers. It's not limited to this but that's our primary focus at the moment.

### Feed

There's a few requirements to the feed and the data itself for you to be eligible for using the service:

- The feed has to be accessible on the internet via a URL. It's fine if it's protected with HTTP Basic Auth or other mechanisms
- The data in the feed has to be structured properly for a machine to parse. Ideally as JSON but we also accept XML and CSV
- We need at least the following information for the offers: title, price and images. We do recommend more info such as savings, quantity, logos, and description
- Most of the images has to be transparent PNG's allowing us to put them on colored backgrounds

### Templates

While the generator is fully automatic we have to build a set of templates for each business initially that represent the brand properly. The templates make sure we use the right colors, font, logo, shapes, etc.

There'll be more info about how a template is structured soon.

### Appendix

You can also provide an appendix for each feed that adds extra info to the generator it can use when it creates Incito automatically. For example, an intro, out, fillers, videos, etc.

#### Offer Tags

If you already use the appendix you can see which tags offers support:

- `layout-disable-image-rotation`: Disables image rotation
- `layout-disable-image-shadow`: Disables the shadow below images

#### Offer Labels

More to come.
