# Incito

Incito is a platform agnostic way to define layout using [JSON](https://www.json.org).

## Reasoning

Since 2009 [ShopGun](https://shopgun.com) has been working with PDF catalogs. We have a lot of experience with making a great digital experience for the PDF's but we feel we've reached their potential. What is the alternative to the PDF? First, let's look at what the PDF catalog does well:

- It looks the same no matter where you open it.
- It can be created once and distributed multiple places.
- It's a visual engaging experience allowing businesses to communicate with people.
- It can be converted into images and be used for reading on a website or app.

However, while great in many regards it also has some downsides:

- One size fits all.
